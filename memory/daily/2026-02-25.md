- Built Horus environment scaffold (configs, plans, runbooks, checklists, data layout) in paper-trading mode with risk guardrails.
- Implemented Horus Phase 2 v1: strategy templates, backtest engine, sample data generator, paper session signal generator, and daily report script (tested).
- Added Horus validation + learning loop: full pipeline test script, trade/signal ledgers, and automated lessons/actions extraction from backtest outcomes.
- Hardened Horus Phase 2.5: added slippage/fee modeling, mean-reversion execution path, regime filter, walk-forward validation script, and re-validated full pipeline.
- Ran crypto paper suite on BTC/ETH/SOL (Coinbase candles), tested strict vs crypto-tuned strategies, and generated pass/fail diagnostics. Only BTC breakout_crypto_v1 passed current gate; identified over-filtering and weak mean-reversion performance.
- Implemented autonomous strategy gating: only pass-qualified coin/strategy pairs can produce paper signals; non-qualified coins auto-skip with reason logs.
