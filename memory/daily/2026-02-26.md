- Built universal plug-and-play backtesting system (fetch/backtest/walkforward/optimize) with free data sources and strategy templates for any ticker/CSV.
- Added backtest diagnostic output layer (execution integrity, strategy performance, cost impact, and next-action diagnosis) with Markdown formatter for quick debugging.
- Ran BTC 15-month autotune cycle (1h data, $1k, 1% risk, RR>=2): executed 3 iterative runs with automatic issue-driven strategy fixes; converged to profitable SMA-cross config (PF 1.4488, ExpR 0.2824, Return 23.27%).
- Executed 50 parallel BTC backtest runs with per-run mistake/fix diagnostics; found systemic drawdown instability across tested parameter space (0/50 passed strict gate).
