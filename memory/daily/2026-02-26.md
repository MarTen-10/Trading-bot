- Built universal plug-and-play backtesting system (fetch/backtest/walkforward/optimize) with free data sources and strategy templates for any ticker/CSV.
- Added backtest diagnostic output layer (execution integrity, strategy performance, cost impact, and next-action diagnosis) with Markdown formatter for quick debugging.
- Ran BTC 15-month autotune cycle (1h data, $1k, 1% risk, RR>=2): executed 3 iterative runs with automatic issue-driven strategy fixes; converged to profitable SMA-cross config (PF 1.4488, ExpR 0.2824, Return 23.27%).
- Executed 50 parallel BTC backtest runs with per-run mistake/fix diagnostics; found systemic drawdown instability across tested parameter space (0/50 passed strict gate).
- Implemented calibrated Monte Carlo, promotion/disable gate engine, and acceptance tests (determinism/risk governor/rollback trigger). Validated gate on BTC best run: PROMOTE + KEEP.
- Ingested new Horus Patch Addendum/Master Directive and converted to mandatory v2 production-readiness checklist with enforceable gates/tests/build-order lock.
- Implemented Horus v2 spec blocks: PostgreSQL schema, deterministic regime classifier, calibration loop (p50/p75/p90), circuit-breaker evaluator, and expanded acceptance tests (incl. calibration + reconciliation SAFE trigger).
- Added VPS live-link scaffolding: runtime entrypoints (run_paper/run_nightly), deploy systemd templates, env/requirements, sqlite bootstrap schema path, and validated nightly + acceptance pipeline.
## PostgreSQL migration + sqlite removal (horus)
- Attempted: Full runtime DB migration from sqlite to PostgreSQL; index verification; logging/config/resource guard hardening; git secret hygiene.
- Changed: Installed PostgreSQL + psycopg2, created/updated `horus` role/db, switched `DATABASE_URL` to postgres in `.env`, replaced sqlite-only code with postgres-only writes (`runtime/dbio.py`, `runtime/paper_execution.py`, `runtime/run_paper.py`, `db/init_schema.py`), replaced schema with runtime-compatible PostgreSQL schema and required indexes, deleted sqlite DB file, restarted `horus-paper.service`, untracked `.env` and pushed commit.
- Outcome: Service running on PostgreSQL; schema/indexes present; runtime writing and reading from PostgreSQL; structured JSON logs active including startup config + resource metrics.
- Reusable lesson: Keep runtime schema aligned with writer code first, then enforce index contract and remove fallback branches to prevent hidden dual-path drift.
- Follow-ups: repo working tree still not globally clean due unrelated data/chatter files outside migration scope.
## OpenClaw approval-flow troubleshooting
- Attempted: Diagnose why user approval replies were not triggering execution.
- Changed: Verified runtime health with `openclaw status` and `openclaw status --deep`; no gateway/session outage detected.
- Outcome: Issue likely input-format mismatch (approval message did not include a concrete pending command/action).
- Reusable lesson: For approval turns, send a concrete command/action string exactly as prompted; placeholders like `<exact action/command>` won’t execute anything.
- Follow-ups: If it repeats with exact command text, run live logs (`openclaw logs --follow`) during approval turn to capture parser behavior.
