- Built universal plug-and-play backtesting system (fetch/backtest/walkforward/optimize) with free data sources and strategy templates for any ticker/CSV.
- Added backtest diagnostic output layer (execution integrity, strategy performance, cost impact, and next-action diagnosis) with Markdown formatter for quick debugging.
- Ran BTC 15-month autotune cycle (1h data, $1k, 1% risk, RR>=2): executed 3 iterative runs with automatic issue-driven strategy fixes; converged to profitable SMA-cross config (PF 1.4488, ExpR 0.2824, Return 23.27%).
- Executed 50 parallel BTC backtest runs with per-run mistake/fix diagnostics; found systemic drawdown instability across tested parameter space (0/50 passed strict gate).
- Implemented calibrated Monte Carlo, promotion/disable gate engine, and acceptance tests (determinism/risk governor/rollback trigger). Validated gate on BTC best run: PROMOTE + KEEP.
- Ingested new Horus Patch Addendum/Master Directive and converted to mandatory v2 production-readiness checklist with enforceable gates/tests/build-order lock.
- Implemented Horus v2 spec blocks: PostgreSQL schema, deterministic regime classifier, calibration loop (p50/p75/p90), circuit-breaker evaluator, and expanded acceptance tests (incl. calibration + reconciliation SAFE trigger).
- Added VPS live-link scaffolding: runtime entrypoints (run_paper/run_nightly), deploy systemd templates, env/requirements, sqlite bootstrap schema path, and validated nightly + acceptance pipeline.
